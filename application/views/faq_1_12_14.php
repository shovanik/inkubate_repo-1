                                    <p class="faq_ans">Inkubate is a portfolio of writers’ works online. It’s also a marketplace where Publishers and agents find new work quickly, organized according to the categories they care about.</p>

                                    <p class="faq_ans">The publishing process today is inefficient, expensive, and decreasingly profitable. Publishers and agents need more efficient ways to discover great new work. Writers need more efficient ways to put their work in front of Publishers/agents, in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Inkubate levels the playing field between Writers and Publishers/agents, and provides new ways for them to find each other.</p>

                                    <p class="faq_ans">Only Publishers and agents who are members of Inkubate will be able to view your work. Their industry credentials are carefully reviewed by Inkubate before they are allowed to join. It is our belief that there are many sites where Writers can post their work for other Writers’ comments, and we honor those sites as important contributors to the writing community. Inkubate’s focus is on linking Writers and Publishers with the objective of getting Writers’ work published.</p>

You should remove your work from our site if it becomes part of a third party negotiation. We honor your requests instantly unless your work is under review by a publisher or agent when you request its removal.</p>

                                    <p class="faq_ans">Inkubate takes copyright and intellectual property rights very seriously; in fact, it is our most important concern. We promise that your property will remain your property. First, our vetting process is very strict; we accept only proven Publishers with good track records. Secondly, Publishers, agents and Writers must review and agree to comprehensive terms and conditions, which provide copyright assurances that are essential and acceptable to all parties. We also keep an audit trail, showing who accessed your work, and when.</p>

Great effort and expense is wasted by Writers, Publishers, and agents in the attempt to find each other. Inkubate replaces this inefficient approach with an organized system that provides Publishers with a quality-driven, consistent process.</p>
