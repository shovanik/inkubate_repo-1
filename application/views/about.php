                        	<p>We’re working hard to create a place that writers, publishers and agents will love. We want you to be as excited as we are, because we believe you’re looking at the future of publishing.</p>
                            <p>Inkubate is the only site designed specifically to show writers’ works to publishers and agents, who can now view the profiles and manuscripts of talented writers everywhere. And, because publishers and agents have told us that they want to know what makes a writer tick, <a href="#">InkubateVoices</a> is our YouTube channel where our writers talk about themselves and their work.</p>
                            <p>We’ve been working with publishers and agents to build the features that will help them find great works, and to put writers in the perfect place to be seen, read, appreciated and discovered.</p>
                            <p>We’re out to make the business of writing fun again.</p>
